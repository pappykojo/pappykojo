Hello there! 👋 Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. You may discover a selection of my endeavors, contributions, and open-source work right here. I enjoy discovering new technologies, coding, and creating fascinating stuff.

## About Me 😎

I work as a software engineer 💻and have a strong interest in all things coding, including web development 🌐, cybersecurity🔒, and everything in between. Making relevant and significant initiatives that address pressing issues and have a positive impact is my main objective.

## Projects 📚

Here are some of the key projects you'll find in my repositories:

- [Project 1](https://github.com/pappykojo/Continuous-Bit-Toggling-using-Code-Composer-Studio): The main objective of this project is to continuously toggle all the bits of Port 1 (P1) using the MSP430AFE223 microcontroller from the MSP430 family, which is pin-compatible with the 8051 microcontroller family.
- [Project 2](https://github.com/pappykojo/Library-management-system): A DSA project for a library management system
- [Project 3](https://github.com/pappykojo/bus-seat-tracker): The Bus Seat Tracker is a simple Python program that helps you keep track of the number of empty seats on a bus at every stop. It allows you to enter the total number of seats on the bus and then iteratively asks for the number of people who left and boarded the bus at each stop. The program then calculates and displays the number of empty seats at each stop.

Feel free to explore the repositories to learn more about these projects and my contributions.
